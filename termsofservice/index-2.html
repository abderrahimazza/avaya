<br />
<strong>2.2</strong> If Customer uses a credit card or other payment mechanism for a transaction, Customer&rsquo;s account is billed at the time of or shortly after Customer&rsquo;s transaction. In such case, Customer hereby authorizes Avaya or its payment processor to bill Customer&rsquo;s credit card or other payment mechanism as may be approved by Avaya in advance or on a periodic basis in accordance with the terms on the order or Service Description or SOW. Customer will provide Avaya with (and maintain) valid and updated credit card information or other payment information reasonably acceptable to Avaya. If a credit card is declined and no replacement card has been entered, Customer&rsquo;s Subscription and access to the Service will be suspended, and Customer agrees to pay any outstanding fees within thirty (30) Business Days after receiving notification from Avaya.&nbsp; If the credit card is accepted on any billing attempt, the Subscription billing date will remain the same as the original date for subsequent months.&nbsp; Receipt by Avaya&rsquo;s payment processor of final good funds in settlement of Customer&rsquo;s credit card or other payment transaction will satisfy Customer&rsquo;s payment obligation. Subject to certain credit requirements as determined by Avaya, Avaya may agree to allow Customer to pay amounts due hereunder in arrears. In such event, Customer will make all of the payments due hereunder within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of the invoice.&nbsp; Customer acknowledges and agrees that if applicable, Customer&rsquo;s credit card on file or other payment mechanism will be automatically charged recurring renewal fees on a monthly basis during the Service Period unless Customer cancels the Subscription (as defined herein).&nbsp; If Customer cancels a Subscription, Customer will not be entitled to a refund or a credit for any fees already due or paid, and Customer may be subject to termination fees as further outlined in the Service Description.&nbsp;<br />

<br />
<strong>2.6 Price Changes. </strong>Avaya reserves the right to change the fees associated with any Services upon thirty (30) calendar days advance written notice.

<br />
<strong>2.7 Taxes</strong>. Unless Customer provides Avaya with a current tax exemption certificate, Customer is solely responsible for paying all legally required taxes, including without limitation any sales, use, excise or other taxes and fees which may be levied upon the Service, except for any (a) taxes that are imposed on, measured by, or based upon net income of Avaya; and (b) taxes in the nature of franchise, doing business, or capital stock taxes if such taxes are based on or measured by capital stock value, par value or net worth of Avaya and are imposed by any taxing jurisdiction in which Avaya is subject to such taxes as a result of transactions or activities not related to these Terms.&nbsp; If Customer is required to bear a tax pursuant to this Section or make any withholding, then Customer will pay such tax and any additional amounts as are necessary to ensure that the net amounts received by Avaya hereunder, after all such payments or withholdings, equal the amounts to which Avaya is otherwise entitled under these Terms as if such tax or withholding did not exist.<br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>18.1 Governing Law</strong>. Any Dispute under these Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of New York, excluding both conflict of law principles and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.<br />
<br />
<strong>18.2 Dispute Resolution</strong>. In the event of any Dispute, the disputing party shall give the other party written notice of the Dispute. The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve each controversy or claim within thirty (30) days, (or other mutually agreed period), following the delivery of notice, by referral to designated representatives of the parties authorized to negotiate resolution thereof.<br />
<br />
<strong>18.3 Arbitration of Non-US Disputes</strong>. Any Dispute that: (i) arose anywhere other than in the United States or is based upon an alleged breach committed anywhere other than in the United States; (ii) cannot be settled under the procedures and within the timeframe set forth in Section18.2; and (iii) is not based upon non-payment, will be conclusively resolved by a final and binding arbitration proceeding in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by a single arbitrator appointed by the parties or (failing agreement) by an arbitrator appointed by the President of the International Chamber of Commerce, except that if the aggregate claims, cross claims and counterclaims by any one party against the other party exceed One Million US Dollars ($1,000,000.00) at the time all such claims&nbsp; are filed, the proceeding will be held in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by a panel of three (3) arbitrator(s) appointed in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language, at a location agreed by the parties or (failing agreement) ordered by the arbitrator(s). The arbitrator(s) will have authority only to award compensatory damages within the scope of the limitations of Section 10 (Limitation of Liability) and will not award punitive or exemplary damages. The arbitrator(s) will not have the authority to limit, expand or otherwise modify these Terms. The ruling by the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on the parties and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties or any of their assets. The parties will evenly split the cost of the arbitrator(s)&rsquo; fees but will each bear their own attorneys&#39; fees and other costs associated with the arbitration. The parties, their representatives, other participants and the arbitrator(s) will hold the existence, content and results of the arbitration in strict confidence to the fullest extent permitted by law. Any disclosure of the existence, content and results of the arbitration will be as limited and narrowed as required to comply with the applicable law. By way of illustration, if the applicable law mandates the disclosure of the monetary amount of an arbitration award only, the underlying opinion or rationale for that award may not be disclosed.<br />
<br />
<strong>18.4 Choice of Forum for US Disputes</strong>. If a Dispute arises in the United States or is based upon an alleged breach committed in the United States and cannot be settled under Section 18.2, then either party may bring an action or proceeding solely in either the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Except as otherwise stated in Section 18.1 each party consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts, including their appellate courts, for the purpose of all actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to these Terms.<br />
<br />
<strong>18.5 Injunctive Relief</strong>. Nothing in these Terms will be construed to preclude either party from seeking provisional remedies, including, but not limited to, temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions from any court of competent jurisdiction in order to protect its rights, including its rights pending arbitration, at any time. The parties agree that the arbitration provision in Section 18.3 may be enforced by injunction or other equitable order, and no bond or security of any kind will be required with respect to any such injunction or order.<br />
<br />
<strong>18.6 Time Limit</strong>. Actions on Disputes between the parties must be brought in accordance with this Section within two (2) years after the cause of action arises. For the avoidance of doubt, this time limit does not trump the fifteen (15) day period in Section 2.5, Payment Disputes.<br />

<br />

<strong>2 ACCEPTANCE PROCEDURES</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>2.1 T&amp;M Services.</strong> T&amp;M Services are deemed accepted upon performance.<br />

<br />
<strong>2.3 SOW with Acceptance Procedures.</strong> &nbsp;Add-On Services or a Project Phase as applicable, are deemed accepted upon the earlier of either: (i) the end of the Acceptance Period as set out in the SOW or Order (as applicable), unless before the end of the Acceptance Period Avaya has received from Customer a Rejection Notice; or (ii) Customer signature of an acceptance certificate. If Add-On Services, Deliverable and/or Project Phase, as applicable, fails to conform to the agreed acceptance criteria and Avaya has received a Rejection Notice, then Avaya will re-perform the non-conforming Add-On Services, Deliverable&nbsp; and/or Project Phase, as applicable, and re-submit it for acceptance as described above. If, after resubmission, Add-On Services, Deliverable and/or Project Phase, as applicable, fail to conform to the agreed acceptance criteria in any material respect, then Customer&rsquo;s remedies will be either to: (a) terminate the non-conforming Add-On Services, Deliverable and/or Project Phase, as applicable, and return all non-conforming Deliverables for a refund of fees paid under the SOW for the non-conforming Add-On Services, Deliverable and/or Project Phase; or (b) accept the Add-On Services, Deliverable and/or Project Phase, as applicable, subject to the warranties and remedies described in this Schedule 1.&nbsp; Customer will be deemed to have accepted the applicable Add-On Services, Deliverable and/or Project Phase in accordance with subsection (b) above if, Avaya has not received a written termination notice within ten (10) days of Avaya&rsquo;s resubmission for acceptance.<br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>2.5 Production Use. </strong>Unless otherwise provided for in Acceptance Procedures, production use will constitute acceptance for all purposes under these Terms.<br />
<br />
<strong>3 Project Delays. </strong>If performance of Add-on Services is delayed for any reason at the request of Customer (including its agents or any third parties acting on its behalf), Avaya may invoice and Customer agrees to pay Avaya, for any additional costs reasonably incurred by Avaya as a direct result of such delay, including, if applicable, rescheduling costs. If such delay continues for more than thirty (30) days Avaya may terminate the SOW, Project Phase or order, as applicable, and will be entitled to invoice, and Customer agrees to pay 100% of the fees associated with the Add-on Services performed to date, and 10% of all sums due for Add-on Services as contained in the relevant order or SOW being cancelled.&nbsp; Where a Customer requests a delay prior to the commencement of Add-on Services, and such delay continues for more than seventy five (75) days, Avaya may terminate the applicable SOW, Project Phase or order as applicable and Customer will pay for the Add-on Services performed to the date of termination plus 10% of the fees that would have been due if the SOW, project phase or order had not been cancelled.<br />
