                        Consider Ramona, who is the customer service manager for a local chain of coffee shops. Her employees need information on topics including gift cards, birthday rewards, rewards points, store locations, and ordering online. 
                            <br><br>
                        Employees need to take customer feedback on in-store experiences, explain how to check balances and re-load gift cards, and even coordinate with stores when local catering is needed for an event. Call volumes and length of calls vary, so Ramona needs to be prepared for everything. 
                            <br><br>
                        With the built-in analytics of Avaya OneCloud CCaaS, you can easily keep a finger on the pulse of your contact center at all times—and quickly adjust to ever changing customer needs.

                    <p>
                        With Avaya OneCloud CCaaS, you know exactly what customers and employees need—before they do.

                    <p>
                        Using the built-in analytics dashboard, Ramona sees call volumes and employee desktop productivity data in real time. She can adjust the number of available employees to match volumes at a certain time of day or implement new self-service options to offset high call volumes and give customers quick answers. And with feedback on interactions, Ramona has a better idea of training needs that can help employees be more confident and exceed customer expectations.

                       Happy employees create better customer experiences.  By simplifying work, you create better outcomes for your employees and customers. Employee turnover can be costly in terms of onboarding and training, and it can be detrimental to the morale of your current employees. 
A customer service center is only as good as its employees.

Jake has been experiencing high turnover in the contact center for his outdoor retail company. Employees have cited a lack of flexibility and complicated systems as reasons for leaving. Jake needs to reduce turnover, attract quality employees, and provide exceptional employee experiences.
